# Object.assign vs Object Spread in Node.js

Test it yourself:
1. clone the repo
2. run installation using ```yarn```
3. run ```npm start```

Up to this day, using Node.js v10.16.3 - you'll get the output:
```js
Object spread x 3,003,908 ops/sec Â±1.32% (88 runs sampled)
Object.assign() x 24,988,830 ops/sec Â±1.18% (88 runs sampled)
Object.assign() is faster ðŸ¤¯
```
